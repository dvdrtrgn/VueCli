      Are the standard patient rates competitive?
    p.
      < Answer>
      Not every program’s standard patient rates are the same,
      and you may be surprised at how favorable some are.
      Talk with financing providers about how their annual
      percentage rates (APR) for patients stack up to the competition.

      Are approval rates and credit limits competitive?
    p.
      < Answer>
      Ask financing companies where their approval rates and credit limits rank among competing programs.
      By choosing a program that approves more patients with enough credit to cover their treatments,
      you’ll help more people get the dental work they need.
    p.
      < Testimonal>
      Your patients will appreciate that you’re allowing them more treatment options they can afford,
      rather than making a decision based on the cash they have on hand.

      What are my costs to use the financing program?
    p.
      < Answer>
      Ask financing providers how their fees compare to others.
      Programs with a full range of financing plans typically charge
      lower fees to use some plans and higher fees for others.
      A program like this helps balance everyone’s costs while
      offering more choice and flexibility for your patients and practice.
      And considering extra costs, like enrollment or service fees,
      will make it easier to compare programs.

      Is the program easy for my staff and me to understand and use?
    p.
      < Answer>
      A novice wouldn’t crown a tooth without guidance.
      And, your financing provider shouldn’t turn over the program without training you first.
      With the right individually-guided training and real-time personal support seven days a week,
      everyone in your office can feel comfortable using the program and talking about it with patients.

      Are there tools and resources to make financing simpler for my staff?
    p.
      < Answer>

      Features like paperless processing tools, marketing help, advertising tips and tools,
      and custom reports from your financing provider make it easier.
